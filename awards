								<li>Attributions</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> The modelling team has simulated the 3-D structures of
							our protein and the aptamer and conducted preliminary rounds of docking to isolate the
							correct aptamer in silico. The Human Practices Team has highlighted details about UTIs that
							are often overlooked by conducting seminars and talks. The BioBricks and the Wet-Lab Teams
							have added basic and composite parts to the registry related to the FimH protein and have
							expressed our protein in strains available in the laboratory. We have also worked tirelessly
							to find sponsors for our project.</p>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> The director of our institute offered his invaluable
							advice to reach out to the local villages and get a different perspective on our project.
							Our professors and the administrative officials of our institute were instrumental in our
							survey in the villages. Our friends and family members have helped us by promoting our
							project in order to reach out to a larger population.</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Project Description</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> Our project focuses on the development of an
							aptamer-based solution to detect uropathogenic bacteria at the point-of-care. Urinary Tract
							Infections (UTIs) are the third most prevalent bacterial infection in India and the second
							most diagnosed infectious disease worldwide. Lack of sanitary hygiene, lack of awareness of
							UTI and unavailability of easy-to-use diagnosis methods at point of care leads to high
							prevalence of UTI particularly in the rural set-up. Several villages located near our
							institute, as per our survey, have shown a frequent occurrence of UTIs, which often go
							ignored and then develop into complications like kidney infections and sepsis. These
							infections, misdiagnosed as common fevers, are treated with a common group of antibiotics
							and paracetamol, leading to antibiotic resistance. These chronic infections are known to be
							highly fatal if not treated in time. In addition, the stigma regarding UTIs and other
							complications have prevented people from approaching doctors regarding treatments.</p>

							<h5><b>Documentation of an existing part <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K1104102">(BBa_K1104102)</a></b></h5>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">We found that Team iGEM13_NYMU-Taipei devised a
							fluorescence
							based methodology to test the functionality of the plac+RFP-FimH
							protein by expressing a in fusion protein of RFP-FimH and then checking
							the Fim H binding to the mannose .Later From our literature surveys (Schembri et al
							Expression and purification of the mannose recognition domain of the FimH adhesin; 01 July
							2000; FEMS Microbiology Letters )related to the testing of FimH protein, we have found
							another in vitro methodology that can serve as a functionality check of purified FimH
							binding to mannose which used alpha-D mannosylated BSA (mimicking the mannose receptor) as
							a matrix for FimH binding .The technique is termed as Receptor Blot.

						<h3><b>
								<li>Engineering Success</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Build:</b>
								<p>We have designed the modelling workflow for aptamer screening for our target ligand
									FimH protein which is more common in uropathogenic bacteria. Our modelling protocol
									goes as follows:
								<ul>
									<li><b>For 3D structure prediction of DNA Aptamers:</b> RNAFold(from sequence to 3D
										predicti on), RNAComposer (from 2D to 3D structure prediction).
									</li>
									<li><b>For 3D structure prediction of Target protein:</b> We have leveraged the
										state of
										the art deep learning model AlphaFold 2 for predicting the 3D structure of FimH
										protein. Further docking procedure is done using AutoDock Tools.
									</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li><b>Test:</b>
								We generated results from a small aptamer library interaction with our target protein.
							</li>
							<li><b>Learn:</b>
								We characterized all the dockings by our screening features like minimum binding free
								energy and generated data for the screening the potential candidate aptamer for our
								detection kit
							</li>
							<li><b>Design:</b>
								We plan to design a multi-plex aptamer to detect several uropathogenic bacteria using
								the current modeling protocol.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Collaboration</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> We had collaboration meetings with IISER Mohali, IISER
							Tirupati, IISER Thiruvananthapuram, NU Kazhakshtan, Rochester University and ICT Mumbai. We
							had insightful discussions on the drylab aspects of the projects. We brainstormed on methods
							to improve the existing molecular simulation protocols for better results and quicker
							workflow cycle. Our meeting with IISER Thiruvananthapuram also extended to Human Practices
							and how we can reach out to larger populations and educate them in the form of fun games and
							presentations regarding the upcoming developments in Synthetic Biology. We are also
							collaborating with them and a few other teams to form a Talk Series on Women’s Health and
							Hygiene, bound to start from the first week of October, 2022. The other teams we had
							meetings with were instrumental in helping us shape our projects to be more efficient and we
							benefited greatly from their advice.</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Human Practices</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> Though the prevalence of UTI is very high, knowledge
							about its symptoms, causes, and treatment is still not widely known in rural settings of
							developing countries like India. To get more in-field information about the prevalence of
							this disease, people from different backgrounds, age groups, and genders were asked
							questions regarding the sanitation conditions of their restrooms and the frequency of the
							symptoms pertaining to urinary tract infections.</p>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> From this initiative we discovered the stigma that the
							rural folks have about, there is this fear that disclosing any information about their
							sanitary hygiene would make them a social outcast. Therefore we decided to develop an POC ,
							a rapid and easy to use tool kit for the detection of UTI, so that they can be assured of
							their privacy while also properly getting diagnosed and treated.</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Proposed Implementation</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> Our project has the potential to reach out to a large
							sector of the population since the affected populations are people from the rural area,
							people with uncontrolled diabetes, and women, in general. We intend to continue this project
							beyond the boundaries of iGEM, the resulting prototype of which will be sent to our industry
							partners for scale-up . We are in constant contact with research labs and industries from
							the healthcare sector, focusing on aptamer selection as well as tagging protocols, who can
							help us fine-tune our project. We have also pitched our project in start-up initiatives like
							‘Start-up Odisha Yatra 2.0’ and have been qualified to discuss our project with the Chief
							Minister of the state of Odisha. Succeeding in this initiative can help us fund projects to
							develop into a large-scale solution for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections.
						</p>
					</ol>



					<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem;"><b>Gold Medal (Any 3 or more criteria to be fulfilled)
						</b></h2>
					<ol>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Integrated Human Practices</li>
							</b></h3>

						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">Our work under integrated human practices has been a
							consistent effort to learn and improve our project. Dr. R. M. Anjana, a renowned diabetes
							specialist, helped us rethink how diabetes medications can cause urinary tract infections.
							This talk has also helped us understand UTI complications, such as how asymptomatic UTIs can
							manifest as chronic kidney complications.</p>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">Our initiative to reach out to local villages has
							brought to light the dismal condition of the restrooms, or lack thereof, as well as the
							correlation between the frequency of usage and cleanliness of the restrooms. Symptoms of
							UTIs, often overlooked in the preliminary stages of infection, become complicated in the
							form of kidney infections . Conversations with the local research laboratories have also
							helped us understand the prevalence of UTIs and the age groups of the affected patients.
							These interactions have helped us shape the way we put our project forward to the public.
						</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Project Modeling</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">Through modelling, we intend to screen and simulate
							aptamers that dock with the highest affinity to our target protein, FimH. For this purpose,
							we generated a random aptamer library, and using softwares like RNA Fold and RNA Composer,
							we generated three dimensional structures of the oligonucleotide sequences. Twist
							Biosciences also provided us with the gene sequence for FimH, which we translated into a 3-D
							structure using AlphaFold2. Our modelling pipeline enable us to run multiple molecular
							docking simulations in parallel inorder to screen a large aptamer library. Using AutoDock
							and visualization softwares like PyMOL we have begun our preliminary screening by
							individually performing molecular docking between the target protein and the aptamer. Our
							Modelling team has also helped generate the program to visualize global data regarding the
							prevalence, incidence and mortality rates of urinary tract infections in a normalized manner
							using heat maps.</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Partnership</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">Surveys regarding the UTI symptoms were sent throughout
							the country via Google forms. These surveys were approved by the medical officer of our
							institute and yielded about 300 to 400 responses from students.</p>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">In collaboration with the Jigyansa team, known for
							their expertise in the local language of our region, Odia, we distributed flyers in Odia in
							multiple villages and learned about their sanitary conditions and their prescription for
							UTI.</p>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify">In collaboration with the IISER TVM team, our team
							plans to conduct a small discussion about Synthetic Biology with bright high schoolers from
							various parts of our country.
							In collaboration with IISER Thiruvananthapuram, IISER Tirupati, and IIT Roorkee, we are
							conducting 'We-talk', a women's health talk series, a three-day event in which the speakers
							are women from various fields of health sciences educating young women about the various
							health issues related to their gender.
						</p>

						<h3><b>
								<li>Education and Communication</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> We partnered with iGEM Team ICT Mumbai on improving
							the presentation of our project on our website and in the modelling aspects, regarding the
							screening and docking of aptamers with our target protein. Our partnership with the team
							during the project helped us finish the milestones we planned. We helped them with
							developing their wiki. We had brainstorming sessions on how to design responsive layouts for
							the wiki page and include dynamic elements, along with better loading animation of the
							content for the web pages. They helped us gain insights into new modelling techniques and
							tools for the structure prediction of DNA aptamers. They offered to help spread our survey
							to areas local to their institute and help us garner responses from a larger demographic. We
							offered to spread their questionnaire regarding the 5 'UTR libraries amongst our faculty and
							research fellows.

								<li>Improvement of an existing part - FimH HIS Tag <a
										href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3953004">(BBa_K3953004)</a>
								</li>
							</b></h3>
						<p class="text-black-50" align="justify"> On the basis of literature survey our team made an
							improvement of an Existing Part in the registry.
							fimH HIS Tag <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3953004">(BBa_K3953004)</a> is a DNA
							part that was developed by iGEM21_Pittsburgh (2021-10-21) which consists of the histidine
							tag sequence that codes for consecutive histidine amino acid residues within the fimH gene.
							From our literature survey (<a
								href="https://www.creative-biostructure.com/his-tagged-proteins-553.htm">His tagged
								Proteins; Creative biostrucrure</a>) we studied that a N teminal or a C terminal His tag
							is usually more desirable to enable easy purification of His tagged Fim H without
							interfering with its conformation. For this we devoloped two constructs Apt4UTI C1(<a
								href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4449009">BBa_K4449009</a>) and Apt4UTI C2(<a
								href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4449010">BBa_K4449010</a>) for expressing C
							terminal and N terminal 6X His tagged Fim H protein respectively. We have also devised some
							methodologies to test our His tagged proteins from our constructs.
